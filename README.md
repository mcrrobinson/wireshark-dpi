# wireshark-dpi
Automates the build and installation of nDPI with Wireshark as it's quite a long process and requires interaction. We all know everyone has something better to do than wait for building to be done.

<pre>
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/mcrrobinson/wireshark-dpi.git
sudo bash wireshark-dpi/run.sh
</pre>
In order to start wireshark run the following command.
<pre>sudo wireshark</pre>
